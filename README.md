This project predicts whether a student can answer the question correctly based on his/her performance in the previous interactions.

## What is in this repository?
This repository includes implementation of state-of-the-art [transformer-based models](transformer_based_models). We also developed [LSTM- and GRU-based models](RNN_based_models) with embedding layers customized to the rich features available in our dataset.
