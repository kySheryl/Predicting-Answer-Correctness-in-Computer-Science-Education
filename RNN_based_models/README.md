# RNN-Based Models
You can find the implementation of the RNN-based models in this folder.

We applied two different types of RNNs, Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) on our answer correctness prediction task. 

PR stands for studentsâ€™ previous responses. "+PR" means that the students' previous responses are utilized as an extra input feature into our models.
