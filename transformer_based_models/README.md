# Transformer-Based Models
You can find the implementation of the transformer-based models in this folder.

We implemented the original SAINT+ and SAKT architectures on our dataset. Furthermore, we modify the features that were present in original SAINT+ and SAKT architectures and extend them so that we can exploit the rich features available in our dataset.
